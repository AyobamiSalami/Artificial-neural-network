# Artificial-neural-network
This project aims at building an artificial neural network for flower recognition. The neural nertwork was trained on a dataset of flowers and the performances of the approcahes used was compared. The approaches used were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)and Residual Network (50) .

Technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, CNN, ResNet50, keras, numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, matplotlib.
